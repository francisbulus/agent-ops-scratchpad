# Codex Session 001 - 2026-02-07 19:38:09Z

## Metadata

- Owner: `francis`
- Title: Implement Codex handoff system
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD commit at start: `21e1042`
- Previous session file: `none`

## Starting Repo Snapshot

- ` M README.md`
- `?? AGENTS.md`
- `?? notes/codex-sessions/`
- `?? scripts/`

## Goal

- Implement a repeatable Codex-to-Codex handoff workflow that preserves context across separate sessions.

## Work Log

- Added `scripts/codex-session` CLI with `start`, `close`, and `status` commands.
- Added `notes/codex-sessions/README.md`, `CURRENT.md`, and `INDEX.md`.
- Added local `AGENTS.md` rules so new Codex sessions read `CURRENT.md` before substantial work.
- Updated root `README.md` with a short section documenting the handoff flow.
- Ran `scripts/codex-session start --title "Implement Codex handoff system"` to initialize this first session file.

## Decisions

- Use one canonical pointer file (`notes/codex-sessions/CURRENT.md`) instead of scanning multiple notes.
- Keep handoff format markdown-first (human-readable in git), with a small helper script for consistency.
- Use an append-only session index (`notes/codex-sessions/INDEX.md`) for traceability.

## Open Risks / Blockers

- No technical blockers in repo.
- Process risk: handoff quality depends on consistently running `scripts/codex-session close`.

## Next Session Must Start With

- Commit and push the new handoff system files.
- Start the next codex session file when new work begins (`scripts/codex-session start --title "..."`).
- Keep `CURRENT.md` as the first file read in all future Codex sessions.

## Handoff Summary

- Implemented and initialized a codex-session handoff system; ready for normal use in future sessions.

## Closeout - 2026-02-07 19:38:33Z

- Summary: Handoff system implemented and initialized with first session record.
- Next step for future session: On the next task, run scripts/codex-session start --title "..." before major edits.
- Blockers: none
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD at close: `21e1042`
