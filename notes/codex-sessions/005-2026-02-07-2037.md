# Codex Session 005 - 2026-02-07 20:37:40Z

## Metadata

- Owner: `francis`
- Title: Break MVP into trackable testable tickets
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD commit at start: `f2483cc`
- Previous session file: `notes/codex-sessions/004-2026-02-07-2021.md`

## Starting Repo Snapshot

- `clean`

## Goal

- Break the MVP into contained, testable tickets and create an in-repo task tracking system.

## Work Log

- Added `notes/tasks/README.md` with tracker rules and status model.
- Added `notes/tasks/TEMPLATE.md` for standardized testable ticket format.
- Added `notes/tasks/BOARD.md` as canonical status board.
- Added 10 MVP ticket files in `notes/tasks/tickets/` with scope, test plan, and acceptance criteria.

## Decisions

- Use markdown-native tracking in-repo for visibility and versioned history.
- Keep ticket units sized for one PR each whenever possible.
- Require test plan + acceptance criteria in every ticket.

## Open Risks / Blockers

- No blocker for planning.
- Execution risk remains around service split decision (single binary vs separate ingest/api).

## Next Session Must Start With

- Pick owner and start `TKT-001` by moving it to `In Progress` in `notes/tasks/BOARD.md`.
- Decide whether to implement `TKT-001` in single service scaffold or keep strict `services/ingest` split.
- After first ticket merge, move status to `Done` and pull next `Ready` ticket.

## Handoff Summary

- MVP planning now has a concrete, testable ticket backlog and board-based tracking workflow.

## Closeout - 2026-02-07 20:39:58Z

- Summary: Added notes/tasks tracker with board, template, and 10 contained testable MVP tickets.
- Next step for future session: Start TKT-001 and move it to In Progress in notes/tasks/BOARD.md.
- Blockers: none
- Branch: `main`
- HEAD at close: `f2483cc`
