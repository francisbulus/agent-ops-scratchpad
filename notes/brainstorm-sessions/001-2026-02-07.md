# Session 001 - 2026-02-07

## Goal

- Define the smallest useful AgentOps MVP for observability + governance.

## MVP Scope

- Ingest core agent events (`request`, `step`, `tool`, `error`, `cost`).
- Show one dashboard for spend, usage, success rate, and top failures.
- Support budget thresholds and basic alerts.
- Provide trace drilldown for failed runs.

## Must-Have Features

- Event ingestion endpoint + validation.
- Storage for raw events and daily aggregates.
- Dashboard cards:
  - Total spend (today, MTD).
  - Total requests + success rate.
  - Top failing workflows.
  - P95 latency by workflow.
- Alert rules:
  - Spend spike over baseline.
  - Success rate drops below threshold.
- Basic governance:
  - Audit log of policy decisions (`allow`, `block`).

## Not in MVP

- Advanced anomaly detection/ML.
- Full invoice/chargeback automation.
- Custom role engine beyond basic admin/viewer.
- Complex policy simulation.

## Suggested Tech Split

- `services/ingest` (Go): high-throughput event ingestion.
- `services/api` (Go): dashboard/query API + auth hooks.
- `apps/dashboard` (TypeScript): UI for metrics, traces, alerts.
- `packages`: shared event schema and API contracts.

## MVP Success Criteria

- 95%+ of agent runs produce complete trace data.
- Dashboard freshness under 60 seconds.
- Alert fires within 2 minutes of threshold breach.
- Can identify root cause for top 3 daily failures in under 10 minutes.

## Open Questions

- Which providers/models are first-class on day 1?
- Multi-tenant from day 1 or single-tenant pilot first?
- What is the billing source of truth initially?

## Next Actions

- Freeze v0 event schema in `packages`.
- Define 2 SLOs: success rate and p95 latency.
- Build ingest service skeleton with one end-to-end trace path.
- Ship first dashboard page with mocked then real data.
